//! The [`StateMachine`] trait — the contract between kernel SMs and the
//! engine-side executor.
//!
//! Engines drive every SM through the same three methods: ask for the next
//! step's work, execute it, hand back the outcome. The SM decides whether
//! to continue to another step or terminate with a typed result.
//!
//! ```text
//! loop {
//!     let op = sm.get_step()?;
//!     let result = executor.execute(op);
//!     match sm.submit(result)? {
//!         NextStep::Continue => continue,
//!         NextStep::Done(r) => return Ok(r),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
