//! Engine-side success payload for one phase yield.
//!
//! Each [`EngineRequest`](super::step::EngineRequest) yielded by an SM produces at most one payload
//! of one of two shapes:
//!
//! - [`EngineRequest::Consume`](super::step::EngineRequest::Consume) -> drain produces one
//!   [`FinishedHandle`].
//! - [`EngineRequest::SchemaQuery`](super::step::EngineRequest::SchemaQuery) -> footer read
//!   produces one [`SchemaRef`].
//!
//! [`EngineResponse`] carries the matching variant directly; the SM body destructures it on
//! resume. The previous keyed `StepResult` accumulator (HashMap + Mutex + first-wins error
//! slot) is gone -- nothing in the protocol can produce more than one payload per yield,
//! so the indirection bought nothing.
