//! CoroutineSM yield/resume protocol shared by the [`CoroutineSM`](super::driver::CoroutineSM)
//! driver and the SSA [`crate::sm_plans::state_machines::framework::plan_context::Context`].
//!
//! Each yield carries a single `StepYield` (operation + static phase name + an optional
//! debug-only live-relation snapshot), and the driver resumes the body with a `StepResume`
//! wrapping the engine outcome. SM bodies emit yields through the SSA `Context`'s
//! `execute` / `execute_consume` helpers; this module only defines the protocol types and
//! the underlying `Engine` alias.
//!
//! # Naming note
//!
//! The `Engine` alias below shares its name with the kernel's connector-facing
//! [`crate::Engine`] trait. They are unrelated -- this `Engine` is the SM-internal yield
//! channel, lives behind `pub(crate)`, and is never exposed in the public API. If a single
//! scope ever needs both names, alias one at the use site (e.g.
//! `use crate::Engine as EngineTrait;`).
