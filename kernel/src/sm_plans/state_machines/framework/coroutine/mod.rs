//! CoroutineSM-backed [`StateMachine`](super::state_machine::StateMachine) implementation.

//! - [`context`] -- the `StepYield` / `StepResume` yield/resume protocol shared by the [`driver`]
//!   and the SSA [`Context`](super::plan_context::Context).
//! - [`driver`] — the [`CoroutineSM<R>`](driver::CoroutineSM) driver that compiles `StepYield`
//!   sequences into the [`StateMachine`](super::state_machine::StateMachine) contract.
//!
//! The underlying stackless-coroutine machinery comes from the
//! [`genawaiter2`] crate. See [`driver`] for the no-panic policy
//! discussion (genawaiter2 panics on protocol misuse; the SSA
//! [`Context`](super::plan_context::Context) dispatch helpers rule out those paths by
//! construction).
