//! KDF trait. One trait every KDF state implements.
//!
//! Adding a new KDF: declare the struct, derive `Clone`, write
//! `impl KernelConsumer for T { ... }` with `kind`, `apply`, `finish`. No
//! enum to edit, no registry to update, no serde wiring — KDFs ride on
//! the [`EngineRequest::Consume`](crate::sm_plans::state_machines::framework::step::EngineRequest::Consume)
//! step, which is dispatched in-process and never serialized.
//!
//! # Object-safety notes
//!
//! - Associated types are NOT on the trait — `Box<dyn KernelConsumer>` must be heterogeneous across
//!   concrete consumer implementations (the executor mixes consumers with different state types).
//!   Typed output lives on the [`crate::sm_plans::kernel_consumers::KernelConsumerOutput`]
//!   companion trait via static dispatch.
//! - `finish(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn Any + Send>` erases the per-impl state type to keep the
//!   trait object-safe. Typed factories downcast inside their extract closure.
